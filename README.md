# Preventive-Maintenance-Analysis 

This project aims to analyze preventive maintenance data using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

# Installation
The project requires installation of the following libraries:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn (Sklearn)
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Imbalanced-learn (Imblearn)

To install the libraries, run the following command:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn imbalanced-learn

# Usage
To use the project, download the preventive_maintenance.csv file and the Preventive_Maintenance_KNN_Analysis.ipynb notebook. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and run the code cells.

# Dataset
The preventive maintenance dataset used in this analysis contains information on the maintenance of machines, including the date of the last maintenance and whether the machine experienced a failure since the last maintenance. The dataset has 10000 rows and 4 columns. We are interested in predicting whether a machine will fail or not based on the other variables.

# KNN Analysis
The KNN algorithm is used to train the model to predict whether a machine will fail or not. The dataset is split into a training set and a test set, and KNN is fitted on the training set. The accuracy of the model is calculated using the test set.

The code in the Preventive_Maintenance_KNN_Analysis.ipynb notebook performs the following steps:

- Import necessary libraries
- Load the preventive_maintenance.csv dataset
- Explore the dataset to view first 5 rows and 5 last rows
- Get information about the dataset to understand it, including the shape and identifying the class
- Select the independent variables X and dependent variable y
- Use seaborn to view class label distribution to determine if class balancing is required
- Split the dataset into test set and training set
- Balance the class using RandomOverSampler
- Fit the KNN into the training set
- Predict the dataset
- Calculate the accuracy of the model
- Display the confusion matrix
- Display the classification report
- Visualize the confusion matrix using seaborn heatmap

# Results
The KNN model achieved an accuracy of 90%. The confusion matrix shows that the model correctly predicted 2321 machine failures and 561 non-failures, and incorrectly predicted 109 non-failures and 9 failures.

The classification report shows precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
